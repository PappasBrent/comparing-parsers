# Arithmetic Expression Interpreter Comparison
In this study we implement a simple interpreter for arithmetic expressions in several programming languages, and compare their performance.

[Here](https://pappasbrent.com/blog/2022/07/24/playing-with-parsers.html) is the accompanying blog post with the list of technologies I used.
If you would like to replicate the study, please refer to the Hardware and Software sections of the post.

Once you have all the necessary software installed, you can run the evaluation by running the script `run_evaluation.py`:

```bash
    $ python3 run_evaluation.py
```

The results will be printed to stdout, and in JSON format to the the file `results.json`.
